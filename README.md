This is a Rust library heavily based on the amazing work done by the [ptouch-print](https://dominic.familie-radermacher.ch/projekte/ptouch-print/) cli program.

It allows you to print images from compatible label makers using a library, instead of shelling out to a command line, and supports all image formats that the [image](https://crates.io/crates/image) crate does.
